Repository to track progress at Southern New Hampshire University

I have come to interpret user needs and implement them by adopting the perspective of the user. User stories are useful in this as they can be written from the perspective of the user and should be broken up into managable chunks. What managable means to each development team varies, but they should be discrete parts of the overall programs functionality. When developing a program I attempt to approach the process from the users perspective and drawing out what the main functionality and look should be. From there I try to break larger goals into specific user stories or tasks. I then prioritize those tasks and try to adopt the agile practice of having usable code at the end of each itteration. Another practice that I have found very useful is using tools such as Jira or Trello to track tasks and to break development cycles into time-boxed sections. Being a good team member to me means doing your best to help deliver the best product you can. There is obviously a lot more nuance to that, but I think it capture the general idea.
